career-profile:
    title: Profile
    summary: |
        As an M.S./Ph.D. integrated student in Industrial & Management Engineering at POSTECH, my research interests lie in combinatorial optimization, specifically in vehicle routing problems, logistics, facility location, and machine scheduling.
        To support my work, I utilize methodologies such as integer programming, (meta) heuristics, and hybridization with artificial intelligence.
        Collaboration with good research partners is always welcome, so feel free to reach out to me. :)
